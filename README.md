# _Y_ 

They _Y_ programming language. 

It's pronounced "why?!!", because people kept asking Why would
I write a native compiler. Why did you do it in Haskell initially?
Why was it called yacll? Just Why?

# Why?

That's a question I keep asking myself every day, also "How?"

## Description 

This is a re-write and continuation of [yacll]( https://github.com/gabriel128/yacll). Even tho I've always 
liked Haskell found the tooling getting in the way 
of some things I was trying to do, so I've started
re-writing it in the language I'm more comfortable at the moment.

# WIP

it's ofc work in progress for now don't use it
